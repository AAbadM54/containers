## Conrefs

conrefs.txt: ibmcloud

conref markdown file: 
The name must start with a letter, can contain letters, numbers, and hyphen (-), and must be 35 characters or fewer. Use a name that is unique across regions. The cluster name and the region in which the cluster is deployed form the fully qualified domain name for the Ingress subdomain. To ensure that the Ingress subdomain is unique within a region, the cluster name might be truncated and appended with a random value within the Ingress domain name.
