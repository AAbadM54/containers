# Tutorial: Installing Istio on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #istio_tutorial}

[Istio ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/info/istio) is an open platform to connect, secure, and manage a network of microservices, also known as a service mesh, on cloud platforms such as Kubernetes in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}. With Istio, you can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices, enforce access policies, verify service identity, and more.
{:shortdesc}

In this tutorial, you can see how to install Istio alongside four microservices for a simple mock bookstore app called BookInfo. The microservices include a product web page, book details, reviews, and ratings. When you deploy BookInfo's microservices into an {{site.data.keyword.containershort}} cluster where Istio is installed, you inject the Istio Envoy sidecar proxies in the pods of each microservice.

**Note**: Some configurations and features of the Istio platform are still under development and are subject to change based on user feedback. Allow a few months for stabilization before you use Istio in production. 

## Objectives

-   Download and install Istio in your cluster
-   Deploy the BookInfo sample app
-   Inject Envoy sidecar proxies into the pods of the app's four microservices to connect the microservices in the service mesh
-   Verify the BookInfo app deployment and round robin through the three versions of the ratings service

## Time required

30 minutes

## Audience

This tutorial is intended for software developers and network administrators who are using Istio for the first time.

## Prerequisites

-  [Install the CLIs](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_install_steps). Istio requires the Kubernetes version 1.9 or higher. Make sure to install the `kubectl` CLI version that matches the Kubernetes version of your cluster.
-  [Create a cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_cli) with a Kubernetes version of 1.9 or higher.
-  [Target the CLI to your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).

## Lesson 1: Download and install Istio
{: #istio_tutorial1}

Download and install Istio in your cluster.
{:shortdesc}



1. Either download Istio directly from [https://github.com/istio/istio/releases ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases) or get the latest version by using curl:

   ```
   curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Extract the installation files.

3. Add the `istioctl` client to your PATH. For example, run the following command on a MacOS or Linux system:

   ```
   export PATH=$PWD/istio-0.8.0/bin:$PATH
   ```
   {: pre}

4. Change the directory to the Istio file location.

   ```
   cd filepath/istio-0.8.0
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Install Istio on the Kubernetes cluster. Istio is deployed in the Kubernetes namespace `istio-system`.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

6. Ensure the pods for the 10 Istio services and for Prometheus are all fully deployed before you continue. The `istio-mixer-post-install` pod has a status of `Completed` and shows `0/1` pods ready.
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n istio-system
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```

   ```
   {: screen}

Good work! You successfully installed Istio into your cluster. Next, deploy the BookInfo sample app into your cluster.


## Lesson 2: Deploy the BookInfo app
{: #istio_tutorial2}

Deploy the BookInfo sample app's microservices to your Kubernetes cluster.
{:shortdesc}

These four microservices include a product web page, book details, reviews (with several versions of the review microservice), and ratings. You can find all files that are used in this example in your Istio installation's `samples/bookinfo` directory.

When you deploy BookInfo, Envoy sidecar proxies are injected as containers into your app microservices' pods before the microservice pods are deployed. Istio uses an extended version of the Envoy proxy to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all microservices in the service mesh. For more about Envoy, see the [Istio documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview/#envoy).

1. Deploy the BookInfo app. When the app microservices deploy, the Envoy sidecar is also deployed in each microservice pod.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n istio-system
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Ensure that the microservices and their corresponding pods are deployed:

   ```
   kubectl get svc -n istio-system
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```

   ```
   {: screen}

3. To verify the app deployment, get the public address for your cluster.

    * For standard clusters:

      1. To expose your app on a public ingress IP, deploy the BookInfo gateway.
          ```
          istioctl create -f samples/bookinfo/routing/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
          ```
          {: pre}
      
      2. Get the ingress IP and port.
          ```
          kubectl get ingress
          ```
          {: pre}

          Example output:
          ```
          NAME      HOSTS     ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
          gateway   *         169.xx.xxx.xxx   80        3m
          ```
          {: screen}

      2. Create a `GATEWAY_URL` environment variable that uses the Ingress IP address.

         ```
         export GATEWAY_URL=<ingress_IP>:80
         ```
         {: pre}

    * For free clusters:

      1. Get the public IP address of any worker node in your cluster.

         ```
         ibmcloud ks workers <cluster_name_or_ID>
         ```
         {: pre}

      2. Create a `GATEWAY_URL` environment variable that uses the public IP address of the worker node.

         ```
         export GATEWAY_URL=<worker_node_public_IP>:$(kubectl get svc istio-ingress -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
         ```
         {: pre}

4. Curl the `GATEWAY_URL` variable to check that the BookInfo app is running. A `200` response means that the BookInfo app is running properly with Istio.
     ```
     curl -I http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
     ```
     {: pre}

5. In a browser, go to `http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage` to view the BookInfo web page.

6. Try refreshing the page several times. Different versions of the reviews section round robin through red stars, black stars, and no stars.

Good work! You successfully deployed the BookInfo sample app with Istio Envoy sidecars. Next, you can clean up your resources or continue on with more tutorials to explore Istio further.

## Cleanup
{: #istio_tutorial_cleanup}

If you're finished working with Istio and don't want to [continue exploring](#istio_tutorial_whatsnext), then you can clean up the Istio resources in your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

1. Delete all BookInfo services, pods, and deployments in the cluster.
   ```
   samples/bookinfo/kube/cleanup.sh
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Uninstall Istio.
   ```
   kubectl delete -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml
   ```
   {: pre}

## What's next?
