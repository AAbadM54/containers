# Controlling traffic with network policies
{: #network_policies}

Every Kubernetes cluster is set up with a network plug-in called Calico. Default network policies are set up to secure the public network interface of every worker node in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{: shortdesc}

If you have unique security requirements or you have a multizone cluster with VLAN spanning enabled, you can use Calico and Kubernetes to create network policies for a cluster. With Kubernetes network policies, you can specify the network traffic that you want to allow or block to and from a pod within a cluster. To set more advanced network policies such as blocking inbound (ingress) traffic to load balancer services, use Calico network policies.

<ul>
  <li>
  [Kubernetes network policies ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/): These policies specify how pods can communicate with other pods and with external endpoints. As of Kubernetes version 1.8, both incoming and outgoing network traffic can be allowed or blocked based on protocol, port, and source or destination IP addresses. Traffic can also be filtered based on pod and namespace labels. Kubernetes network policies are applied by using `kubectl` commands or the Kubernetes APIs. When these policies are applied, they are automatically converted into Calico network policies and Calico enforces these policies.
  </li>
  <li>
  [Calico network policies ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/advanced-policy): These policies are a superset of the Kubernetes network policies and are applied by using `calicoctl` commands. Calico policies add the following features.
    <ul>
    <li>Allow or block network traffic on specific network interfaces regardless of the Kubernetes pod source or destination IP address or CIDR.</li>
    <li>Allow or block network traffic for pods across namespaces.</li>
    <li>[Block inbound (ingress) traffic to Kubernetes LoadBalancer or NodePort services](#block_ingress).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

Calico enforces these policies, including any Kubernetes network policies that are automatically converted to Calico policies, by setting up Linux Iptables rules on the Kubernetes worker nodes. Iptables rules serve as a firewall for the worker node to define the characteristics that the network traffic must meet to be forwarded to the targeted resource.

To use Ingress and load balancer services, use Calico and Kubernetes policies to manage network traffic into and out of your cluster. Do not use IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) [security groups](/docs/infrastructure/security-groups/sg_overview.html#about-security-groups). IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) security groups are applied to the network interface of a single virtual server to filter traffic at the hypervisor level. However, security groups do not support the VRRP protocol, which {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses to manage the load balancer IP address. If the VRRP protocol isn't present to manage the load balancer IP, Ingress and load balancer services do not work properly.

## Default Calico and Kubernetes network policies
{: #default_policy}

When a cluster with a public VLAN is created, a HostEndpoint resource with the `ibm.role: worker_public` label is created automatically for each worker node and its public network interface. To protect the public network interface of a worker node, default Calico policies are applied to any host endpoint with the `ibm.role: worker_public` label.
{:shortdesc}

These default Calico policies allow all outbound network traffic and allow inbound traffic to specific cluster components, such as Kubernetes NodePort, LoadBalancer, and Ingress services. Any other inbound network traffic from the internet to your worker nodes that isn't specified in the default policies is blocked. The default policies don't affect pod to pod traffic.

Review the following default Calico network policies that are automatically applied to your cluster.

Do not remove policies that are applied to a host endpoint unless you fully understand the policy. Be sure that you do not need the traffic that is being allowed by the policy.

In Kubernetes version 1.10 and later clusters, a default Kubernetes policy that limits access to the Kubernetes Dashboard is also created. Kubernetes policies don't apply to the host endpoint, but to the `kube-dashboard` pod instead. This policy applies to clusters connected only to a private VLAN and clusters connected to a public and private VLAN.

## Installing and configuring the Calico CLI
{: #cli_install}

To view, manage, and add Calico policies, install and configure the Calico CLI.
{:shortdesc}

1. [Log in to your account. Target the appropriate region and, if applicable, resource group. Set the context for your cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure). Include the `--admin` option with the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config` command, which is used to download the certificates and permission files. This download also includes the keys to access your infrastructure portfolio and run Calico commands on your worker nodes.

  ```
  ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name> --admin
  ```
  {: pre}

2. Download the Calico configuration file to run all Calico commands.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name_or_ID> --network
    ```
    {: pre}

3. For OSX and Linux users, complete the following steps.
    1. Create the `/etc/calico` directory.
        ```
        sudo mkdir /etc/calico
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Move the Calico configuration file that you previously downloaded to the directory.
        ```
        sudo mv /Users/<user>/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/<cluster_name>-admin/calicoctl.cfg /etc/calico
        ```
        {: pre}

4. [Download the Calico CLI ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/projectcalico/calicoctl/releases/tag/v3.3.1).

    If you are using OSX, download the `-darwin-amd64` version. If you are using Windows, install the Calico CLI in the same directory as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. This setup saves you some filepath changes when you run commands later. Make sure to save the file as `calicoctl.exe`.
    {: tip}

5. For OSX and Linux users, complete the following steps.
    1. Move the executable file to the _/usr/local/bin_ directory.
        - Linux:

          ```
          mv filepath/calicoctl /usr/local/bin/calicoctl
          ```
          {: pre}

        - OS X:

          ```
          mv filepath/calicoctl-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/calicoctl
          ```
          {: pre}

    2. Make the file an executable file.

        ```
        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/calicoctl
        ```
        {: pre}

6. If corporate network policies use proxies or firewalls to prevent access from your local system to public endpoints, [allow TCP access for Calico commands](cs_firewall.html#firewall).

7. Verify that the Calico configuration is working correctly.

    - Linux and OS X:

      ```
      calicoctl get nodes
      ```
      {: pre}

    - Windows: Use the `--config` flag to point to the network config file that you got in step 1. Include this flag each time you run a `calicoctl` command.

      ```
      calicoctl get nodes --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      ```
      {: pre}

      Output:

      ```
      NAME
      kube-dal10-crc21191ee3997497ca90c8173bbdaf560-w1.cloud.ibm
      kube-dal10-crc21191ee3997497ca90c8173bbdaf560-w2.cloud.ibm
      kube-dal10-crc21191ee3997497ca90c8173bbdaf560-w3.cloud.ibm
      ```
      {: screen}

    {: pre}

**To view network policies in clusters**:

Linux and Mac users don't need to include the `--config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg` flag in `calicoctl` commands.
{: tip}

1. View the Calico host endpoint.

    ```
    calicoctl get hostendpoint -o yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
    ```
    {: pre}

2. View all of the Calico and Kubernetes network policies that were created for the cluster. This list includes policies that might not be applied to any pods or hosts yet. For a network policy to be enforced, a Kubernetes resource must be found that matches the selector that was defined in the Calico network policy.

    [Network policies ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy) are scoped to specific namespaces:
    ```

## Adding network policies
{: #adding_network_policies}

In most cases, the default policies do not need to be changed. Only advanced scenarios might require changes. If you find that you must make changes, you can create your own network policies.
{:shortdesc}

To create Kubernetes network policies, see the [Kubernetes network policy documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

To create Calico policies, use the following steps.

Before you begin:
1. [Install and configure the Calico CLI.](#cli_install)
2. [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure). Include the `--admin` option with the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config` command, which is used to download the certificates and permission files. This download also includes the keys to access your infrastructure portfolio and run Calico commands on your worker nodes.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name> --admin
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Define your Calico [network policy ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy) or [global network policy ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/globalnetworkpolicy) by creating a configuration script (`.yaml`). These configuration files include the selectors that describe what pods, namespaces, or hosts that these policies apply to. Refer to these [sample Calico policies ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/advanced-policy) to help you create your own. Note that Kubernetes version 1.10 or later clusters must use Calico v3 policy syntax.

2. Apply the policies to the cluster.
    - Linux and OS X:

      ```
      calicoctl apply -f policy.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

    - Windows:

      ```
      calicoctl apply -f filepath/policy.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      ```
      {: pre}

## Controlling inbound traffic to load balancer or node port services
{: #block_ingress}

[By default](#default_policy), Kubernetes NodePort and LoadBalancer services are designed to make your app available on all public and private cluster interfaces. However, you can use Calico policies to block incoming traffic to your services based on traffic source or destination.
{:shortdesc}

Default Kubernetes and Calico policies are difficult to apply to protecting Kubernetes NodePort and LoadBalancer services due to the DNAT Iptables rules generated for these services. However, pre-DNAT policies prevent specified traffic from reaching your apps because they generate and apply Iptables rules before Kubernetes uses regular DNAT to forward traffic to pods.

Some common uses for Calico pre-DNAT network policies:

  - Block traffic to public node ports of a private load balancer service: A load balancer service makes your app available over the load balancer IP address and port and makes your app available over the service's node ports. Node ports are accessible on every IP address (public and private) for every node within the cluster.
  - Block traffic to public node ports on clusters that are running [edge worker nodes](cs_edge.html#edge): Blocking node ports ensures that the edge worker nodes are the only worker nodes that handle incoming traffic.
  - Block traffic from certain source IP addresses or CIDRs (blacklisting)
  - Allow traffic from only certain source IP addresses or CIDRs (whitelisting), and block all other traffic

To see how to whitelist or blacklist source IP addresses, try the [Using Calico network policies to block traffic tutorial](cs_tutorials_policies.html#policy_tutorial). For more example Calico network policies that control traffic to and from your cluster, you can check out the [stars policy demo ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/stars-policy/) and the [advanced network policy ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/getting-started/kubernetes/tutorials/advanced-policy).
{: tip}

1. Define a Calico pre-DNAT network policy for ingress (inbound traffic) access to Kubernetes services.
    * Kubernetes version 1.10 or later clusters must use [Calico v3 policy syntax ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.1/reference/calicoctl/resources/networkpolicy).
    * If you manage traffic to a [version 2.0 load balancer service](cs_loadbalancer.html#planning_ipvs), you must include the `applyOnForward: true` and `doNotTrack: true` fields to the `spec` section of the policy.

        Example resource that blocks all node ports:

        ```
        apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
        kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
        metadata:
          name: deny-nodeports
        spec:
          applyOnForward: true
          ingress:
          - action: Deny
            destination:
              ports:
              - 30000:32767
            protocol: TCP
            source: {}
          - action: Deny
            destination:
              ports:
              - 30000:32767
            protocol: UDP
            source: {}
          preDNAT: true
          selector: ibm.role=='worker_public'
          order: 1100
          types:
          - Ingress
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        Example resource that whitelists traffic from only a specified source CIDR to a load balancer 2.0:

        ```
        apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
        kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
        metadata:
          name: whitelist
        spec:
          applyOnForward: true
          doNotTrack: true
          ingress:
          - action: Allow
            destination:
              nets:
              - <loadbalancer_IP>/32
              ports:
              - 80
            protocol: TCP
            source:
              nets:
              - <client_address>/32
          preDNAT: true
          selector: ibm.role=='worker_public'
          order: 500
          types:
          - Ingress
        ```
        {: codeblock}

2. Apply the Calico preDNAT network policy. It takes about 1 minute for the
policy changes to be applied throughout the cluster.

  - Linux and OS X:

    ```
    calicoctl apply -f deny-nodeports.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

  - Windows:

    ```
    calicoctl apply -f filepath/deny-nodeports.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Optional: In multizone clusters, a multizone load balancer (MZLB) health checks the Ingress application oad balancers (ALBs) in each zone of your cluster and keeps the DNS lookup results updated based on these health checks. If you use pre-DNAT policies to block all incoming traffic to Ingress services, you must also whitelist [Cloudflare's IPv4 IPs ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) that are used to check the health of your ALBs. For steps on how to create a Calico pre-DNAT policy to whitelist these IPs, see Lesson 3 of the [Calico network policy tutorial](cs_tutorials_policies.html#lesson3).

## Isolating clusters on the private network
{: #isolate_workers}

If you have a multizone cluster, multiple VLANs for a single zone cluster, or multiple subnets on the same VLAN, you must [enable VLAN spanning](/docs/infrastructure/vlans/vlan-spanning.html#vlan-spanning) so that your worker nodes can communicate with each other on the private network. However, when VLAN spanning is enabled, any system that is connected to any of the private VLANs in the same IBM Cloud account can communicate with workers.

You can isolate your cluster from other systems on the private network by applying [Calico private network policies ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/tree/master/calico-policies/private-network-isolation). This set of Calico policies and host endpoints isolate the private network traffic of a cluster from other resources in the account's private network.

The policies target the worker node private interface (eth0) and the pod network of a cluster.

**Worker nodes**

* Private interface egress is permitted only to pod IPs, workers in this cluster, and the UPD/TCP port 53 for DNS access, port 2049 for communication with NFS file servers, and ports 443 and 3260 for communication to block storage.
* Private interface ingress is permitted only from workers in the cluster and only to DNS, kubelet, ICMP, and VRRP.

**Pods**

* All ingress to pods is permitted from workers in the cluster.
* Egress from pods is restricted only to public IPs, DNS, kubelet, and other pods in the cluster.

Before you begin:
1. [Install and configure the Calico CLI.](#cli_install)
2. [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure). Include the `--admin` option with the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config` command, which is used to download the certificates and permission files. This download also includes the keys to access your infrastructure portfolio and run Calico commands on your worker nodes.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name> --admin
    ```
    {: pre}

To isolate your cluster on the private network using Calico policies:

1. Clone the `IBM-Cloud/kube-samples` repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples.git
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Navigate to the private policy directory for the Calico version that your cluster version is compatible with.
   ```
   cd <filepath>/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/calico-policies/private-network-isolation/calico-v3
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Set up a policy for the private host endpoint.
    1. Open the `generic-privatehostendpoint.yaml` policy.
    2. Replace `<worker_name>` with the name of a worker node and `<worker-node-private-ip>` with the private IP address for the worker node. To see your worker nodes' private IPs, run `ibmcloud ks workers --cluster <my_cluster>`.
    3. Repeat this step in a new section for each worker node in your cluster. **Note**: Each time you add a worker node to a cluster, you must update the host endpoints file with the new entries.

4. Apply all of the policies to your cluster.
    - Linux and OS X:

      ```
      calicoctl apply -f allow-all-workers-private.yaml
      calicoctl apply -f allow-ibm-ports-private.yaml
      calicoctl apply -f allow-egress-pods.yaml
      calicoctl apply -f allow-icmp-private.yaml
      calicoctl apply -f allow-vrrp-private.yaml
      calicoctl apply -f generic-privatehostendpoint.yaml
      ```
      {: pre}

    - Windows:

      ```
      calicoctl apply -f allow-all-workers-private.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      calicoctl apply -f allow-ibm-ports-private.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      calicoctl apply -f allow-egress-pods.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      calicoctl apply -f allow-icmp-private.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      calicoctl apply -f allow-vrrp-private.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      calicoctl apply -f generic-privatehostendpoint.yaml --config=filepath/calicoctl.cfg
      ```

## Controlling traffic between pods
{: #isolate_services}

Kubernetes policies protect pods from internal network traffic. You can create simple Kubernetes network policies to isolate app microservices from each other within a namespace or across namespaces.
{: shortdesc}

For more information about how Kubernetes network policies control pod-to-pod traffic and for more example policies, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).
{: tip}

### Isolate app services within a namespace
{: #services_one_ns}

The following scenario demonstrates how to manage traffic between app microservices within one namespace.

An Accounts team deploys multiple app services in one namespace, but they need isolation to permit only necessary communication between the microservices over the public network. For the app Srv1, the team has frontend, backend, and database services. They label each service with the `app: Srv1` label and the `tier: frontend`, `tier: backend`, or `tier: db` label.

<img src="images/cs_network_policy_single_ns.png" width="200" alt="Use a network policy to manage cross-namespace traffic." style="width:200px; border-style: none"/>

The Accounts team wants to allow traffic from the frontend to the backend, and from the backend to the database. They use labels in their network policies to designate which traffic flows are permitted between microservices.

First, they create a Kubernetes network policy that allows traffic from the frontend to the backend:

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: backend-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: Srv1
      tier: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: Srv1
          Tier: frontend
```
{: codeblock}

The `spec.podSelector.matchLabels` section lists the labels for the Srv1 backend service so that the policy applies only _to_ those pods. The `spec.ingress.from.podSelector.matchLabels` section lists the labels for the Srv1 frontend service so that ingress is permitted only _from_ those pods.

Then, they create a similar Kubernetes network policy that allows traffic from the backend to the database:

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: db-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: Srv1
      tier: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: Srv1
          Tier: backend
  ```
  {: codeblock}

The `spec.podSelector.matchLabels` section lists the labels for the Srv1 database service so that the policy applies only _to_ those pods. The `spec.ingress.from.podSelector.matchLabels` section lists the labels for the Srv1 backend service so that ingress is permitted only _from_ those pods.

Traffic can now flow from the frontend to the backend, and from the backend to the database. The database can respond to the backend, and the backend can respond to the frontend, but no reverse traffic connections can be established.

### Isolate app services between namespaces
{: #services_across_ns}

The following scenario demonstrates how to manage traffic between app microservices across multiple namespaces.

Services owned by different subteams need to communicate, but the services are deployed in different namespaces within the same cluster. The Accounts team deploys frontend, backend, and database services for the app Srv1 in the accounts namespace. The Finance team deploys frontend, backend, and database services for the app Srv2 in the finance namespace. Both teams label each service with the `app: Srv1` or `app: Srv2` label and the `tier: frontend`, `tier: backend`, or `tier: db` label. They also label the namespaces with the `usage: accounts` or `usage: finance` label.

<img src="images/cs_network_policy_multi_ns.png" width="475" alt="Use a network policy to manage cross-namepsace traffic." style="width:475px; border-style: none"/>

The Finance team's Srv2 needs to call information from the Accounts team's Srv1 backend. So the Accounts team creates a Kubernetes network policy that uses labels to allow all traffic from the finance namespace to the Srv1 backend in the accounts namespace. The team also specifies the port 3111 to isolate access through that port only.

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  Namespace: accounts
  name: accounts-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: Srv1
      Tier: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
    - NamespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          usage: finance
      ports:
        port: 3111
```
{: codeblock}

The `spec.podSelector.matchLabels` section lists the labels for the Srv1 backend service so that the policy applies only _to_ those pods. The `spec.ingress.from.NamespaceSelector.matchLabels` section lists the label for the finance namespace so that ingress is permitted only _from_ services in that namespace.

Traffic can now flow from finance microservices to the accounts Srv1 backend. The accounts Srv1 backend can respond to finance microservices, but can't establish a reverse traffic connection.

In this example, all traffic from all microservices in the finance namespace is permitted. You can't allow traffic from specific app pods in another namespace because `podSelector` and `namespaceSelector` can't be combined.

## Logging denied traffic
{: #log_denied}

To log denied traffic requests to certain pods in your cluster, you can create a Calico log network policy.
{: shortdesc}

When you set up network policies to limit traffic to app pods, traffic requests that are not permitted by these policies are denied and dropped. In some scenarios, you might want more information about denied traffic requests. For example, you might notice some unusual traffic that is continuously being denied by one of your network policies. To monitor the potential security threat, you can set up logging to record every time that the policy denies an attempted action on specified app pods.

Before you begin:
1. [Install and configure the Calico CLI.](#cli_install)
2. [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure). Include the `--admin` option with the `ibmcloud ks cluster-config` command, which is used to download the certificates and permission files. This download also includes the keys to access your infrastructure portfolio and run Calico commands on your worker nodes.
    ```
    ibmcloud ks cluster-config <cluster_name> --admin
    ```
    {: pre}

To create a Calico policy to log denied traffic:

1. Create or use an existing Kubernetes or Calico network policy that blocks or limits incoming traffic. For example, to control traffic between pods, you might use the following example Kubernetes policy named `access-nginx` that limits access to an NGINX app. Incoming traffic to pods that are labeled "run=nginx" is allowed only from pods with the "run=access" label. All other incoming traffic to the "run=nginx" app pods is blocked.
    ```
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    metadata:
      name: access-nginx
    spec:
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          run: nginx
      ingress:
        - from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                run: access
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Apply the policy.
    * To apply a Kubernetes policy:
        ```
        kubectl apply -f <policy_name>.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
        The Kubernetes policy is automatically converted to a Calico NetworkPolicy so that Calico can apply it as Iptables rules.

    * To apply a Calico policy:
        ```
        calicoctl apply -f <policy_name>.yaml --config=<filepath>/calicoctl.cfg
        ```
        {: pre}

3. If you applied a Kubernetes policy, review the syntax of the automatically created Calico policy and copy the value of the `spec.selector` field.
    ```
    calicoctl get policy -o yaml <policy_name> --config=<filepath>/calicoctl.cfg
    ```
    {: pre}

    For example, after being applied and converted, the `access-nginx` policy has the following Calico v3 syntax. The `spec.selector` field has the value `projectcalico.org/orchestrator == 'k8s' && run == 'nginx'`.
    ```
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: access-nginx
    spec:
      ingress:
      - action: Allow
        destination: {}
        source:
          selector: projectcalico.org/orchestrator == 'k8s' && run == 'access'
      order: 1000
      selector: projectcalico.org/orchestrator == 'k8s' && run == 'nginx'
      types:
      - Ingress
    ```
    {: screen}

4. To log all the traffic that is denied by the Calico policy that you created earlier, create a Calico NetworkPolicy named `log-denied-packets`. For example, use the following policy to log all packets that were denied by the network policy that you defined in step 1. The log policy uses the same pod selector as the example `access-nginx` policy, which adds this policy to the Calico Iptables rule chain. By using a higher order number, such as `3000`, you can ensure that this rule is added to the end of the Iptables rule chain. Any request packet from the "run=access" pod that matches the `access-nginx` policy rule is accepted by the "run=nginx" pods.  However, when packets from any other source try to match the low-order `access-nginx` policy rule, they are denied. Those packets then try to match the high-order `log-denied-packets` policy rule. `log-denied-packets` logs any packets that arrive to it, so only packets that were denied by the "run=nginx" pods are logged. After the packets' attempts are logged, the packets are dropped.
    ```
    apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: log-denied-packets
    spec:
      types:
      - Ingress
      ingress:
      - action: Log
        destination: {}
        source: {}
      selector: projectcalico.org/orchestrator == 'k8s' && run == 'nginx'
      order: 3000
    ```
    {: codeblock}
